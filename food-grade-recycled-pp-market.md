<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Food Grade Recycled PP Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Post-industrial Resin (PIR)</li><li>Post-consumption Resin (PCR)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Food Grade Recycled PP market is largely divided into two types: Post-Industrial Resin (PIR) and Post-Consumption Resin (PCR). PIR comes from manufacturing processes where plastic materials are discarded, representing a controlled source that allows for consistent quality. Conversely, PCR is derived from consumer products after their lifecycle, often presenting greater variability in material quality. Both types are essential for sustainable packaging solutions, contributing to a circular economy by reducing reliance on virgin materials while meeting safety standards for food applications.</p></p>
